# Data Science Notes
**Everything here is subject to change**
### About
The purpose of this project is to document common subjects needed for someone to work as a data scientist. I am not a teacher or expert in any of the subjects found here, but merely self taught hobbyist with bachelor's degree in computer science. Documenting my notes is a conscious choice to have something concrete of my knowledge. If someone - student perhaps - finds my notes beneficial, it would be a high honor for me. However these is primarily meant for myself.

The subjects here consist of mathematics, statistics, machine learning algorithms, their applications in data science and much more. The format used in documents is Jupyter Notebook. That way I am able to include interactive Python code examples, which is perhaps the most popular programming language used in data science.
