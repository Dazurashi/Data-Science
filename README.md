# Data Science Notes
**Everything here is subject to change**
### About
The purpose of this project is to document common subjects needed for someone to work as a data scientist. I am not a teacher or expert in any of the subjects found here, but merely self taught hobbyist with bachelor's degree in computer science. Documenting my notes is a conscious choice to have something concrete of my knowledge. If someone - student perhaps - finds my notes beneficial, it would be a high honor for me. However these is primarily meant for myself.

The subjects here consist of mathematics, statistics, machine learning algorithms, their applications in data science and much more. I will do my best to update this project daily. The format used in documents is Jupyter Notebook. That way I am able to include interactive Python code examples, which is perhaps the most popular programming language used in data science.
