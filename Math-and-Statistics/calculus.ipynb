    "Calculus helps in finding the minimum or maximum values of a function, which is essential in optimization algorithms. For instance in machine learning you often want to minimize a loss function to improve the accuracy of your model. Calculus will also allow us to understand how changes in input values affect the output. This is important in predictive modeling, where you need to understand the sensitivity of your predictions to changes in the data. Not to mention how many real world phenomena are continuous, and calculus provides the tools to model and analyze those systems. This is particularly relevant in fields like physics, biology and finance where data can be modeled using continuous functions. \n",

    "One of the popular applications of calculus - which we will talk about later in this document - is *gradient decent* in machine learning. Another very useful application is to use calculus in predictive maintenance. This is where you would use the help of calculus to model the degradation process of machine parts over time in a mechanical system. By understanding the rate of change in the condition of the machine parts, a company can predict when the maintenance is needed and perform it beforehand to avoid larger downtime."
