    "Calculus helps in finding the minimum or maximum values of a function, which is essential in optimization algorithms. For instance in machine learning you often want to minimize a loss function to improve the accuracy of your model. Calculus will also allow us to understand how changes in input values affect the output. This is important in predictive modeling, where you need to understand the sensitivity of your predictions to changes in the data. Not to mention how many real world phenomena are continuous, and calculus provides the tools to model and analyze those systems. This is particularly relevant in fields like physics, biology and finance where data can be modeled using continuous functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the popular applications of calculus - which we will talk about later in this document - is *gradient decent* in machine learning. Another very useful application is to use calculus in predictive maintenance. This is where you would use the help of calculus to model the degradation process of machine parts over time in a mechanical system. By understanding the rate of change in the condition of the machine parts, a company can predict when the maintenance is needed and perform it beforehand to avoid larger downtime."

    "This rather self-explanatory word is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point. It helps us understand the behavior of functions near a specific points, even if the function is not explicitly defined at those points. The more intuitive explanation would be to imagine you are walking towards a wall. As you get closer, the distance between you and the wall degreases (duh...). The limit describes what happens to the distance as you get infinitely close to the wall.\n",

    "## Gradient Descent \n",
    "Now for the most objectively interesting part of this document, the gradient descent. To be completely honest, this subject deserves its own document because there are multiple extensions of this mathematical application, but since it is related to calculus, I will try to keep this more brief in this document. In the last Python example there will be a small program instead of the type of scripting you have seen above. There is a lot to talk about so lets get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>What is Gradient Descent?</ins>\n",
    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the steepest descent - the direction of the greatest decrease - as defined by the negative of the gradient. In simpler terms, it helps us find the lowest point of a function, which is often the goal in machine learning tasks like training a model. In data science and machine learning, we often deal with functions that represent some kind of error or cost. In other words, how bad our model is at making predictions. By minimizing this error functions, we improve the performance of our model. Gradient descent is the method that helps us achieve this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>How Does Gradient Descent Work?</ins>\n",
    "For this section I am going tell you a small imaginative story which describes \"accurately\" how gradient descent works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Think of a landscape with hills and valleys. Soon you will be sent there with a special phone. The phone is only able to make calls when you are close to the lowest point in this landscape. Your goal is to find it so you can call a helicopter to pick you up. You are also equipped with special goggles limiting your vision. To combat this, a voice from your phone will tell you which way the uphill is (gradient).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You are enter a teleport which takes you to a random point on this landscape. This represents an initial guess of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At each step, you look around to see which direction slopes down the steepest. This direction is given to you by your phone. It tells you where the uphill is, so naturally you need to move in the opposite direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then you decide to take a step. The size of the step is determined by how bold or cautious you are. This parameter is also something called *learning rate*. A small step means you are being cautious, while big step means you are being bold. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. You repeat the process: calculate the gradient, take a step, and update your position. Each step should ideally bring you closer to the lowest point.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The stop condition happens when you phone beeps, telling you it is now possible to make a call. This means that you are close to the valley's bottom. However sometimes there are different rules where calls become available after certain fixed amount of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused? Lets look at the mathematical explanation next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>Mathematical Explanation</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient\n",
    "The gradient of a function $f$ at a point $x$ is a vector of partial derivatives:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla f(x) = [\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, \\dots \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE:*** Here $x$ does not mean x-axis but is just a placeholder for any parameter $x_n$. Usually the case is more complex because there can be millions of parameters. We would run out of letters if we used them to describe each individually, so normally you would see $\\theta$ and $(\\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\dots \\theta_n)$(theta) instead. For the sake of simplicity, we wont be using those in the examples of this document but you will see them more in machine learning documents. Also the $\\nabla$ symbol is read \"nabla\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Descent Update Rule\n",
    "To update our current position $x$ in the direction of the steepest descent, we need to use the following rule:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{\\mathbf{new}} = x - \\alpha \\nabla f(x)\n",

    "where:\n",
    "- $x_\\mathbf{new}$ is the new position.\n",
    "- $x$ is the current position.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "- $\\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient at the current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Function Example\n",
    "Now lets look at a very basic quadratic function $f(x) = x^2$. We want to find the value of $x$ that minimized this function. Without even doing anything, you can probably guess that it is $0$ but lets see how we can get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the gradient: The gradient of $f(x) = x^2$ is $\\frac{d}{dx}x^2 = 2x$.\n",
    "2. Initialize: Start with an initial guess, say $x=3$. Yes, we take a guess.\n",
    "3. Choose a learning rate: Lets choose $\\alpha = 0.1$.\n",
    "4. Update:\n",
    "    - Compute the gradient at $x=3$: $\\nabla f(3) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\n",
    "    - Update $x$: $x_{\\mathbf{new}} = 3 - 0.1 \\cdot 6 = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4$.\n",
    "5. Repeat:\n",
    "    - Compute the gradient at $x=2.4$: $\\nabla f(2.4) = 2 \\cdot 2.4 = 4.8$.\n",
    "    - Update $x$: $x_{\\mathbf{new}} = 2.4 - 0.1 \\cdot 4.8 = 2.4 - 0.48 = 1.92$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you repeat the update process enough times - or steps - you will eventually reach at $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Variable Example\n",
    "I will show you another example but this time we have our old friend from previous sections, $f(x,y) = 3x^2y + 2xy^2 + y$. Since we already know each other, we know that the partial derivatives are: \\\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 6xy + 2y^2$ \\\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3x^2 + 4xy + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Guess: Start with $(x,y) = (1,1)$.\n",
    "2. Gradient calculation: $\\nabla f(1,1) = (6 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1^2, 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 + 1) = (8,8)$ \n",
    "3. Update rule: $x_{\\mathbf{new}} = 1 - \\alpha \\cdot 8$ and $y_{\\mathbf{new}} = 1 - \\alpha \\cdot 8$\n",
    "4. And so far and so forth repeating if necessary... "
