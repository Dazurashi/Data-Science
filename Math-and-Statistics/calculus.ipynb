    "Calculus helps in finding the minimum or maximum values of a function, which is essential in optimization algorithms. For instance in machine learning you often want to minimize a loss function to improve the accuracy of your model. Calculus will also allow us to understand how changes in input values affect the output. This is important in predictive modeling, where you need to understand the sensitivity of your predictions to changes in the data. Not to mention how many real world phenomena are continuous, and calculus provides the tools to model and analyze those systems. This is particularly relevant in fields like physics, biology and finance where data can be modeled using continuous functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the popular applications of calculus - which we will talk about later in this document - is *gradient decent* in machine learning. Another very useful application is to use calculus in predictive maintenance. This is where you would use the help of calculus to model the degradation process of machine parts over time in a mechanical system. By understanding the rate of change in the condition of the machine parts, a company can predict when the maintenance is needed and perform it beforehand to avoid larger downtime."

    "\n",
    "### <ins>What is a Limit?</ins>\n",
    "This rather self-explanatory word is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point. It helps us understand the behavior of functions near a specific points, even if the function is not explicitly defined at those points. The more intuitive explanation would be to imagine you are walking towards a wall. As you get closer, the distance between you and the wall degreases (duh...). The limit describes what happens to the distance as you get infinitely close to the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>Formal Definition</ins>\n",
    "The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a values $a$ is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x) = L\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that as $x$ gets closer and closer to $a$, $f(x)$ gets closer to $L$ (limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>Basic Examples</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1. Simple Function**: For $f(x) = 2x$, find the limit as $x$ approaches 3.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow 3}\\ 2x = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To really spell it out what happens here is that the function's limit is at 6 when $x$ is in its limit 3 and we want to know the limit of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2. Constant Function**: For $f(x) = 5$, find the limit as $x$ approaches any number $a$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow a}\\ 5 = 5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it always 5? Well that is because it is a constant. More noticeably you can see that there is no $x$ value on the right side which means that no matter what value $x$ or $a$ was, the function stays at 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Piercewise Function**: For $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2 & \\text{if } x \\neq 2 \\\\ 5 & \\text{if } x = 2\\end{cases}$, find the limit as $x$ approaches 2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow 2}\\ x^2 = 4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though $f(x)$ is 5 when $x$ = 2, the limit depends on the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 2, not the value at 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>Limits Approaching Zero</ins>\n",
    "When we talk about a limit as $x$ approaches zero, we are interested in what happens to the function $f(x)$ as $x$ gets very close to zero but not necessarily equal to zero.\n",

    "For example: $\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\ \\frac{1}{x}$\n",
    "- As $x$ approaches zero from the positive side ($x \\rightarrow 0^+$), $\\frac{1}{x}$ becomes very large.\n",
    "- As $x$ approaches zero from the negative side ($x \\rightarrow 0^-$), $\\frac{1}{x}$ becomes very large negatively.\n",
    "- Hence the limit does not exist in a conventional sense because the function approaches different values from the positive and negative sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "However we can say:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0^+}\\ \\frac{1}{x} = \\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0^-}\\ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: $\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\ \\mathbf{sin}(\\frac{1}{x})$\n",
    "- This one does not have a limit in conventional sense either because $\\mathbf{sin}(\\frac{1}{x})$ oscillates between -1 and 1 as $x$ approaches zero, without settling on a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <ins>Limits Approaching Infinity</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the concept above, when we talk about a limit as $x$ approaches infinity ($x \\rightarrow \\infty$) or negative infinity ($x \\rightarrow -\\infty$), we are interested in what happens to the function $f(x)$ as $x$ gets very large or very large negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow \\infty}\\ \\frac{1}{x}$\n",
    "- As $x$ increases, $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets smaller and smaller.\n",
    "- Therefore:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow \\infty}\\ \\frac{1}{x} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Second example: $\\mathbf{lim}_{x \\rightarrow \\infty}\\ \\mathbf{ln}(x)$\n",
    "- As the $x$ increases, the natural logarithm of $x \\ (\\mathbf{ln}(x))$ also increases, but at a slower rate.\n",
