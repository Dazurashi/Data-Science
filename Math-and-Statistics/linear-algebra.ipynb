    "## **Importance to Data Science**\n",
    "Data is often represented in vectors and matrices. Linear algebra is the tool to handle and manipulate those. Linear algebra plays an important role in machine learning. For example one of the most simplest and common machine learning algorithm is *linear regression* which uses linear algebra to find best-fit line for predicting outcomes. It's also present in *optimization*, *neural networks*, *image recognition*, *recommendation systems* and many more areas. Knowing linear algebra is essential to computer and data science. "

    "#### 1. Dimension\n",
    "- The number of elements in a vector is called its dimension. For example a vector with 3 elements is called a 3-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Notation\n",
    "- Vectors are often written as a column of numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
