    "## **Importance to Data Science**\n",
    "Probability is the foundation of statistical methods. It plays a key role in data science themes like probabilistic models such as *Bayesian networks* and *Gaussian processes*, further expanding to machine learning algorithms. It is also critical to understand probability theory when doing error analysis and risk assessments. In this document we wont dive deep into any of these subjects but explore the core basics of understanding several probability concepts. However you might see these fancier applications in the future documents. Overall, probability theory provides the mathematical framework and tools necessary for dealing with the inherent uncertainty and variability in data, making it indispensable in data science for analysis, modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n"
